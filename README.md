# Minix_System_Calls
The aim of this assignment is for you to gain an understanding of how system calls are implemented in Minix and to access and use operating system data structures. To this end, you will add system calls to the Minix Process Manager (PM).

You will implement system calls to:

- select an array of process ids from a specified index in the PM's process table
- get the name of a process (identified by its pid)
- get information about the children of a given process (identified by its pid)
